CLIMADA - the open-source and -access global platform for probabilistic multi-hazard risk modelling and options appraisal https://wcr.ethz.ch/research/climada.html (CLIMADA infograph at the bottom of that webpage, narrated here)
Using state-of-the-art probabilistic modelling CLIMADA allows to estimate multi-hazard socio-economic impacts as a measure of risk today, the incremental increase from economic development and the further incremental increase due to climate change. The Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology as implemented in CLIMADA provides decision makers with a fact base to understand the impact of weather and climate on their economies, including cost/benefit and multi-criteria perspectives on specific risk reduction and resiliency measures as well as risk transfer solutions. The CLIMADA platform is well suited to operate on diverse spatio-temporal scales, e.g. from impact-based warning applications (regional to local, timescale of days) to providing an open and independent global (yet still high-resolution) view on physical risk (including tail risk quantification), in line with eg the TCFD (Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure).
